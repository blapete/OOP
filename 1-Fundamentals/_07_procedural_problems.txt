The common problem of the previous versions:

All the data the functions operate on is stored in one or more global variables, this is bad practice.



1. Any function that uses global data cannot be easily reused in a different program.

2. Beacuse variable values can change anywhere, it can be difficult to debug and maintain programs written this way.

3. Having the ability to modify any data in a large data structure can lead to errors, such as accidentally overwriting data the function was not intended to touch.
