A mechanism for deriving a new class from an existing class.

Rather than starting from scratch and duplicating code, write code for a new class that extends or differentiaties it from an existing class.

The basic idea:

Build a class (a subclass) that incorporates all the methods and instance variables of another class (a base class)  to reuse existing code.

The new subclass can choose to use or override the methods of the base class or define its own methods.

A method in a subclass can find the base class by using a call to super().
