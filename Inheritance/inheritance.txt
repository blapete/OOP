A mechanism for deriving a new class from an existing class.

Rather than starting from scratch and duplicating code, write code for a new class that extends or differentiaties it from an existing class.

The basic idea:

Build a class (a subclass) that incorporates all the methods and instance variables of another class (a base class)  to reuse existing code.

The new subclass can choose to use or override the methods of the base class or define its own methods.

A method in a subclass can find the base class by using a call to super().

"Programming by difference"


Base class:
The class that is inherited from;it serves as a strarting point for the subclass.

Subclass:
The class that is doing the inherting; it enhances the base class.

Abstract class:
A class that is not intended to be instantiated directly, but only used a s abase class by one or more subclasses. (in some other languages, an abstract class is referred to as a virtual class)

Abstract method:
A method that must be overriden in ever subclass.
