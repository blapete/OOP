Pygame does not come with built-in basic user interface elements, they need to be built by the programmer.

This will demonstrate how standard widgets such as images, buttons, and input or output fields can be built as classes and how client code uses them.

Building each element as a class allows programmers to incorporate multiple instances of each element when creating a GUI.
