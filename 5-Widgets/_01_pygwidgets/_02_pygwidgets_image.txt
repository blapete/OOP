Create an image before the main loop starts:

oImage = pygwidgets.Image(window, (100,200), 'images/SomeImage.png')

In the main loop, call:

oImage.draw()

The draw method of the Image class contains blit() to draw the image, so the programmer won't have to call blit() directly.

To move the image, call its setLoc() method, specifying the new x- and y- coordinates as a tuple:

oImage.setLoc((newX, newY))

The next time it is drawn, it will show up at the new coordinates.



The Sprite Module

Pygame has a built-in module to show images in a window, called the sprite module.

Such images are called sprites.

The module provides a Sprite class for handling individual sprites and a gorupl class for handling multuple Sprite objects.

These classes provide excellent functionality and if intending to do heavy-duty pygame programming, is worth a look.
