Pygwidgets contains a number of other classes.



The ImageCollection class shows any single image from a collection of images.

Example:

The programmer has images of a character facing front, left, back, and right.

To represent all the potential images, build a dictionary:

imageDict = {'front':'images/front.png', 'left':'images/left.png', 'back':'images/back.png', 'right':'images/right.png'}

Then create an ImageCollection object, specifying this dictionary and the key of the image to start with.

To change to a different image, call the replace() method and pass in a different key.

Calling the draw() method at the bottom of the loop always shows the current image.



The Dragger class displays a single image but allows the user to drag the image anywhere in the window.

Its handlEvent() method is called in the event loop.

When the user finishes dragging, handleEvent() returns True.

Call the Dragger object's getMouseUpLoc() method to get the location where the user released the mouse button.



The Animation and SpriteSheetAnimation classes handle building and showing an animation.

Both require a set of images to iterate through.

The Animation class gets the images from individual fiiles.

The SpriteSheetAnimation class requires a single image with evenly spaced internal images.
