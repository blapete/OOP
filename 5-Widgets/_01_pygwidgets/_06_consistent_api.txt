Important note for building an API for a set of classes:

It's a very good idea to build consistency into the parameters of methods in different, but similar, classes.

Example:

The first two parameters to the __init__() method of every class in pygwidgets are window and loc, in that order.

If these had been in a different order in some calls, using the package as a whole would be much more difficult.



If classes implement the same functionality, it's a good idea to use the same method names.

Example:

Many of the classes in pygwidgets have a method named setValue() and another named getValue().
