The arguments in a call to a function and the parameters defined in the function have a one-to-one relationship.

The value of the first argument is given to the first parameter, the value of the second argument is given to the second parameter, and so on.

Python (and some other languages) allows the programmer to make some of the arguments optional.

If an optional argument isn't provided in a call, the programmer can provide a default value to use in the function or method instead.
