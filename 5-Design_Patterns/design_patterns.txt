Design patterns are reusable OOP solutions to commonly occurring software problems.

Design pattern examples:
- Using an object manager object to manage a list or dictionary of objects
- Model View Controller

Model View Controller:
MVC is used to break a system into smaller, more manageable and more modifiable parts.It efnorces a clear split between a collection of data and the way that data is represented to the user.

The pattern separates the functionality into three parts: the model, the view, and the controller. Each part has a clearly defined responsibility, and each is implemented by one of more objects.

The model stores data.

The view is responsible for drawing the information from the model in one of perhaps multiple ways.

The controller typically creates the model and view objects, handles all user interactions, communicates changes to the model, and tells the view to display the data.

This separation makes the overall system highly maintainable and modifiable.
