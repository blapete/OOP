A well-written class can be easily reused in many different programs. Classes do not need to access global data. Instead, objects provide code and data at the same level.

2.

OOP can greatly reduce the number of global variables required, because a class provides a framework in which data and code that acts on the data exist in one grouping. This also tends to make code easier to debug.

Objects created from a class only have access to their own data - their set of the instance variables in the class. Even when there are multiple objects created from the same class, they do not have access to each other's data.
