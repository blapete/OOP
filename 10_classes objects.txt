Class:
Code that defines what an object will remember (its data or state) and the things that it will be able to do (its functions or behavior).

Instantiation:
The process of creating an object from a class.

Method:
A function defined inside a class. A method always has at least one parameter, which is usually named self.



- The first method in every class has the special name __init__.

- Whenever an object is created from a class, this method runs automatically, any initialization code goes in __init__.

- The __init__() method is not strictly required, but considered good practice to include it.

- Python takes care of constructing the object (allocating memory) for you.

- The special __init__() method is called the "initializer" method, where you give variables initial values.

- Most other OOP languages require a method named new(), which is often referred to as a constructor.
