The variable name self is not a keyword in Python but is used by convention.

Any other name could be used and the code would work fine.

Using self is a universally accepted practice in Python.

For code to be understood by other Python programmers, the name self is used as the first parameter in all methods of a class.

Other OOP languages have the same concept but use other names, such as this or me.
