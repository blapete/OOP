SimpleButton and SimpleText.

The interface refers to how something is used.

The implementation refers to how something works internally.



In an OOP environment:

The interface is the set of methods in a class and their related paramters - known as the application programming interface (API).

The implementation is the actual code of all the methods in the class.



An external package such as pygame will most likely come with documentation of the API.

The docs exaplins the calls that are available and the arguments expected to be passed to each call.



When writing code that makes calls to pygame, the programmer does not need to worry about the implementation of the methods.

Making a call to blit(), they do not care how blit() does what it does; they just need to know what the call does and what arguments need to be passed in.

On the other side, they can trust that the implementer(s) who wrote the blit() method have thought extensively about how to make blit() work most efficiently.



In the programming world, the programmer often wears two hats as both the implementer and the application developer.

Design APIs that not only make sense in the current situation, but are general enough to be used by future programs and by programs written by other programmers.

The SimpleButton and SimpleText classes are good examples, as they are written in a general way so that they can be reused easily.
