The previous approach for checking and reacting to events:

if oButton.handleEvent(event):
    print('The button was clicked')

This works for the SimpleButton class.



Many other programming languages (and some Python packages) handle events with a callback.

Callback:

A function or method of an object that is called when a particular action, event, or condition happens.

Consider a button object that is initialized to have a callback.

When the user clicks the button, the button will call the callback function or method.

That function or method executes whatever code is needed to react to the button click.
