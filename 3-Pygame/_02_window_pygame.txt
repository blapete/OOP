To write a pygame application, the width and height of the window need to be specified.

Within the window, any pixel can be addressed using its x- and y-coordinates.

Position (3,5) would be the fourth column right and 5th row down because the coordinates start at 0.

Each pixel in a window is commonly referred to as a point.

To reference a point in a window, typically a python tuple would be used.

Example:

pixelLocation = (3, 5)

To show an imaage in a window, the coordinates of its starting point need to be specified as an (x, y) pair, this is always the upper-left corner of the image.



When working with an image, the programmer will often need to deal with the bounding rectangle.

The bounding rectangle is the smallest rectangle that can be made that completely surrounds all pixels of an image.

A rectangle is represented in pygame by a set of four values: x, y, width, height.

Even if an image is not rectangular (a circle or ellipse), the programmer still needs to consider its bounding rectangle for positioning and collision detection.
