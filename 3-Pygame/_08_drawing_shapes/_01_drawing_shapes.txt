Pygame has built-in functions to draw certain shapes known as primitives.

These shapes included lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, polygons, and rectangles.



pygame.draw.aaline()        Draws an anti-aliased line

pygame.draw.aalines()       Draws a series of anti-aliased lines

pygame.draw.arc()           Draws an arc

pygame.draw.circle()        Draws a circle

pygame.draw.ellipse()       Draws an ellipse

pygame.draw.line()          Draws a line

pygame.draw.lines()         Draws a series of lines

pygame.draw.polygon()       Draws a polygon

pygame.draw.rect()          Draws a rectangle



There are two calls that draw anti-aliased lines.

These are lines that include blended colors at the edges to make the lines look smoth and less jagged.

There are two advantages to using these drawing functions:

- They execute extremely quickly

- They can draw simple shapes without having to create or load images from external files
