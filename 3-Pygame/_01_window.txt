Pixel:

The smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen.

A computer screen is made up of a large number of rows and columns of small dots (pixels/picture element).



A user interacts with a GUI through one or more windows.

Each window is a rectuangular portion of a screen.

Programs can control the color of any individual pixel in their window(s).



If multiple GUI programs are running, each program is typically displayed in its own window.




The Window Coordinate system:

Computer window coordinates work in a similar way to a Cartesian grid.

Any point in a Cartesian grid can be located by specifying its x-axis and y-coordinates.

The origin is the point specified as (0,0) and is found in the center of the grid.



There are a few key differences between this and the computer window coordinate system:

The origin (0,0) point is in the upper-left corner of the window.

The y-axis is reversed so that y values start at zero at the top of the window and increase as you go down.

The x and y values are always integers. Each (x,y) pair specifies a single pixel in the window. These values are always specified as relative to the upper left corner of the window.



The full computer screen has its own set of (x,y) coordinates for every picel and uses the same tyoe of coordinate system, but programs rarely, if ever, need to deal with screen coordinates.
