There are two ways to handle user keyboard interactions:

1.
Individual key presses

Each key press generates two events: key down and key up

The two events have different event types: pygame.KEYDOWN and pygame.KEYUP



2.
When a user holds down a key to indicate an action should happen as long as that key is down (continuous mode)

Poll the keyboard

<aTuple> = pygame.key.get_pressed()

This returnes a tuple of 0s and 1s representing the state of each key: 0 if the key is up, 1 if the key is down

Then use constants defined within pygame as an index into the returned tuple to see if a particular key is down

Example to determine the state of the A key:

keyPressedTuple = pygame.key.get_pressed()
aIsDown = keyPressedTuple[pygame.K_a]           # Use a constant here to get the appropriate element of the tuple
