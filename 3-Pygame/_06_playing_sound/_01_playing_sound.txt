Two types of sounds in pygame programs:

1.
Short sound effects

All sound effects must live in external files and must be in either .wav or .ogg format.

Two steps to play a short sound effect: 

- Load the sound from an external sound file once

<soundVariable> = pygame.mixer.Sound(<path to sound file>)

<path to sound file> is a path string where the sound file can be found.

- Play the sound at the appropriate time

<soundVariable>.play()

2.
Background music

Background music must live in external files and can be .mp3, .wav, or .ogg files.

Two steps to play background music:

- Load the sound file into the memory

pygame.mixer.music.load(<path to sound file>)

<path to sound file> is a path string where the sound file can be found.

- Start playing the music

pygame.mixer.music.play(<number of loops>, <starting position>)

<number of loops> can be set to -1 for music to play forever.

<starting position> can be set to 0 to play the sound from the beginning.
