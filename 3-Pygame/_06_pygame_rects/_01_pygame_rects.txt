The previous location animation keep tracks of the current x- and y-coordinates of the ball in separate variables.

A different way:

- Use the ball rect

- Update the rect of the ball in every frame

- Check if performing the update would cause any part of the rect to move outside an edge of the window

Fewer variables and works with images of any size.



Rect objects maintain a number of attributes (including the rectangle left, top, width, and height).

They can be accessed using dot syntax:

<rect>.x               The x-coordinate of the left edge of the rect

<rect>.y               The y-coordinate of the top edge of the rect

<rect>.left            The x-coordinate of the left edge of the rect (same as <rect>.x)

<rect>.top             The y-coordinate of the top edge of the rect (same as <rect>.y)

<rect>.right           The x-coordinate of the right edge of the rect

<rect>.bottom          The y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the rect

<rect>.topleft         A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the rect

<rect>.bottomLeft      A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the rect

<rect>.topright        A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the upper-right corner of the rect

<rect>.bottomright     A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the lower-right corner of the rect

<rect>.midtop          A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the midpoint of the top edge of the rect

<rect>.midleft         A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the midpoint of the left edge of the rect

<rect>.midbottom       A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the midpoint of the bottom edge of the rect

<rect>.midright        A two-integer tuple: the coordinates of the midpoint of the right edge of the rect

<rect>.center          A two-integer tuple: the coordinates at the center of the rect

<rect>.centerx         The x-coordinate of the center of the width of the rect

<rect>.centery         The y-coordinate of the center of the height of the rect

<rect>.size            A two-integer tuple: the (width, height) of the rect

<rect>.width           The width of the rect

<rect>.height          The height of the rect

<rect>.w               The width of the rect (same as <rect>.width)

<rect>.h               The height of the rect (same as <rect>.height)



A rect also can be thought of and accessed as a list of four elements, an index can be used to get or set any individual part.

Example using ballRect:

ballRect[0] is the x value (or use ballRect.left)

ballRect[1] is the y value (or use ballRect.top)

ballRect[2] is the width (or use ballRect.width)

ballRect[3] is the height (or use ballRect.height)
