Two parts to showing a graphic image.

1. Load the image into the computer's memory.

2. Display the image in the application window.



Path:

A String that uniquely identifies the location of a file or folder on a computer.

To load a graphic or sound file into the program, the path to the file must be specified.

Also called a pathname.



Two types of paths.

1. Relative path

A relative to the current folder (current working directory).

IDEs set the current folder to the one containing the main python program so relative paths can be used.

The relative path for a graphic file in the same folder as the main Python file would just be the filename as a string ex. 'ball.png'.

If it were in a folder that is in the same file as the main Python program it would be 'folder/ball.png'.

2. Absolute path

If the program will be run from the command line, then absolute paths need to be constructed for all files.

An absolute path is one that starts from the root of the filesystem and includes full hierarchy of folders to the file.

To build an absolute path to any file:

from pathlib import Path
BASE_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
pathToBall = BASE_PATH + 'images/ball.png'
