How to import class code:

Place the code of the class in a file by itself and import into the program that uses it.

_02_account_OOP.py is just the definition of a class.

As classes become larger and more complicated, saving each of them in a separate file is the preferred way to work with them.

To use the Account class, build another .py file and import the code, as done with  other built-in packages like random and time.

Python programmers often name the main program that imports other class files main.py or Main_<SomeName>.py.

For this example, the importing will be done from within the same folder.
